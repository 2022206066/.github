# Hello there!
 _(insert General Grievous .gif here)_
 
## This GitHub organisation is a repository collection of my projects made during Software & Information Engineering studies at Singidunum University in Belgrade.
Any & all external sources used in said projects are noted & credited in their respective README files, with hyperlinks to original sources whenever possible.
Should you have any questions, feel free to email me at aleksa.tanaskovic2001@gmail.com. To reduce confusion & help me out a bit, please put "github" somewhere in the email title.
